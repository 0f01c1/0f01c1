I'm a security researcher with a keen interest in enterprise software and web applications. My past work has focused on hypervisors, .NET applications, and web app pentesting.

Currently, I'm an Offensive Security Engineer at TikTok where I research native components of the mobile application and cloud infrastructure.

This blog is a collection of all the bits of knowledge I've gained over the years and anything else I find interesting in the security space. 0f01c1 is the x86 opcode for the vmcall instruction - I spent a lot of time reading the [Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html) on a previous project, so the name seemed fitting.

And yes, all the images on this blog are AI-generated ;)
